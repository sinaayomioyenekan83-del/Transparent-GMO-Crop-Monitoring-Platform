# 🌱 Transparent GMO Crop Monitoring Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary blockchain-based platform for monitoring GMO crops! This project leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to provide transparent, immutable tracking of GMO crop lifecycles, ensuring compliance with international regulations like those from the USDA, EU GMO directives, and Codex Alimentarius. Farmers, regulators, and auditors can log data on-chain for verifiable audits, reducing fraud, enhancing trust, and enabling real-time compliance checks.

## ✨ Features

🔍 Real-time monitoring of GMO crop data from seed to harvest  
📊 Immutable audit trails for regulatory compliance  
⚖️ Automated compliance verification against global standards  
👥 Multi-stakeholder access: Farmers register crops, auditors verify, regulators oversee  
🚨 Alerts for non-compliance issues  
📈 Reporting tools for generating on-chain compliance reports  
💰 Incentive tokens for accurate reporting  
🔒 Secure data hashing to protect sensitive information while maintaining transparency  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Farmers**  
- Register your farm and GMO seeds using the Registry Contract.  
- Log monitoring data (e.g., growth stages, genetic tests, pesticide use) via the Monitoring Contract.  
- Submit compliance proofs, which are automatically checked by the Compliance Contract.  

**For Auditors and Regulators**  
- Use the Audit Contract to review immutable logs and perform on-chain audits.  
- Query the Reporting Contract for detailed reports on specific crops or regions.  
- Trigger alerts through the Notification Contract if discrepancies are found.  

**Core Workflow**  
1. A farmer registers a new GMO crop batch with details like seed type, planting date, and location hash.  
2. Periodic updates are logged, creating an immutable chain of data.  
3. Compliance rules (e.g., no unauthorized gene edits) are enforced automatically.  
4. Auditors can verify the entire history without trusting intermediaries.  
5. Incentives are distributed via tokens for compliant farmers.  

This setup solves real-world problems like opaque supply chains in agriculture, where GMO regulations vary globally and enforcement is challenging. By using blockchain, it ensures tamper-proof records, reduces paperwork, and fosters international trade through verifiable compliance.

## 📂 Smart Contracts Overview

The platform is built with 8 Clarity smart contracts for modularity, security, and scalability:  

1. **Registry Contract**: Handles registration of users (farmers, auditors, regulators) and GMO crop batches. Stores hashed identifiers for privacy.  
2. **Monitoring Contract**: Allows logging of crop monitoring data (e.g., soil tests, growth metrics) with timestamps. Ensures data is appended immutably.  
3. **Compliance Contract**: Defines rules based on international standards and automatically verifies submitted data against them.  
4. **Audit Contract**: Provides functions for querying historical data and performing on-chain audits, generating proof-of-compliance.  
5. **Token Contract**: Manages a fungible token (e.g., GMO-Token) for incentivizing accurate reporting and penalizing non-compliance.  
6. **Oracle Contract**: Integrates external data feeds (e.g., weather or lab results) via trusted oracles to enrich monitoring data.  
7. **Notification Contract**: Sends on-chain alerts for compliance violations or audit requests to relevant stakeholders.  
8. **Reporting Contract**: Aggregates data from other contracts to generate customizable reports, exportable for off-chain use.  

Each contract interacts via public functions, ensuring composability. For example, the Monitoring Contract calls the Compliance Contract to validate logs in real-time.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install the Clarinet tool for Clarity development.  
2. Clone this repo and deploy the contracts to a Stacks testnet.  
3. Use the provided scripts to interact: e.g., `clarinet console` to register a crop.
